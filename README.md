# Abyssalatry

[Latests realiese v1.0.0-demo](https://github.com/megurte/Danmaku-project/releases/tag/game)

### About the game:
This game is a Danmaku shooter, which is not a popular genre these days. However, I still wanted to implement a similar game to gain experience and to have a finished project in my developer portfolio. The action takes place in a fictional universe in the kingdom called Astria, where magical arts are one of the pillars of science and education. In the plot, a young girl named Amelia goes to the library of the academy at night. However, when she gets there, she hears a rumble and turns around to see a dark silhouette. Seeing Amelia, the silhouette tries to hide, and the girl goes after it in pursuit.

### The list of features that didn't make it into the demo build includes:
- An art with a narrative, which explains the subplot of the game and the endings through stylized pictures
- Dialogues (I thought it would look strange in the demo without the rest of the story)
- Difficulty levels (in the game's creation window, you can select the difficulty, but for the demo, there is only one level, with the same number of points and the same settings)
- Decorative animations (which require additional artistic input from me)
- The rest of the levels and bosses.

### The basic rules for scoring at the end of a level are as follows:
- Points for completing the level
- Points for remaining time from each boss phase
- Points for the selected difficulty level
- Points collected on the level
- Points for not using the special spell
- Points for not taking damage.

I should say right away that the music is not mine, and I don't claim the rights. This is temparence music for [demo](https://github.com/megurte/Danmaku-project/releases/tag/game) version.
